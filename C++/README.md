# ⚔️ HackerRank C++ Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to C++ challenges from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp).

## Structure
Each file is named after the challenge it solves:
- `Say-Hello-World-With-C++.cpp` → Solution for [Say Hello, World! With C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-hello-world/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- `Input-and-Output.cpp` → Solution for [Input and Output](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem?isFullScreen=true)
- ...

## Achievements & Badge Levels
On HackerRank, you earn **badges** for solving challenges.  
Here’s how the **C++ badge** system works:

| Star Level   | Badge   | Points Needed |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 1 Star       | Bronze  | 10 points     |
| 2 Star       | Bronze  | 40 points     |
| 3 Star       | Silver  | 70 points     |
| 4 Star       | Silver  | 150 points    |
| 5 Star       | Gold    | 250 points    |

## How to Earn Points
- Solve challenges in the C++ practice tracks.
- Participate in official HackerRank contests (points get added later).
- Note: Unlocking the editorial first will **not** count towards points.

## Tools I Use
- **G++ Compiler** (comes with MinGW/GCC/Clang) → for compiling locally
- **VS Code / CLion** → for writing and testing solutions
- **HackerRank C++ Session** → to practice & test solutions online
